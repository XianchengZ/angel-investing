# Development of Contract

In order to develop contract efficiently in a local development, I choose hardhat for this.

`scripts` folder won't be used, because we don't deploy this contract from here.

The `test` folder will be heavily used for contracts unit testing purpose.

### Design Decision

Ethereum is not as stable and liquidity as USD, therefore, a lot of uncertainty could happen in today's market. This would become a further optimization on top of using ETHERS. However, we will stick to ETH for now.
